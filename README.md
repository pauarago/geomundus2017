# Geomundus 2017 Workshop
## Managing Geospatial data with R
11 November 2016. MÃ¼nster, Germany

R has become an important and useful programing language for statistical computing. As an open source language, the community has contributed with a large amount of packages available in the CRAN repository, within which there are several that deals with geospatial data. In this workshop, we are going to learn how to open spatial files directly in R, access their internal structure, and plot maps with R. The goal is to prepare geospatial data for statistical computing in R.
